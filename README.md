# Simple Number Square Generator

A basic Python program that generates squares of consecutive numbers (1², 2², 3², ...).

## Description

This project demonstrates the use of Python generators to create an infinite sequence of squared numbers. The user can specify how many squared numbers they want to generate, and the program will display them in a list.

## Features

- Uses Python generators for memory-efficient number generation
- Input validation (handles non-numeric input and negative numbers)
- Clean, readable code structure
- Error handling for user input

## How it works

The program generates squares using the formula: `n²` where n starts from 1 and increments infinitely.

Example output:
```
How many squared numbers do you want to generate? 5
First 5 squared numbers: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

## Usage

1. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python generator.py
   ```

2. Enter the number of squared numbers you want to generate

3. The program will display the results
